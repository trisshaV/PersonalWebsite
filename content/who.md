### hello! and selamat datang :wave:
---
I'm Trissha, currently a software engineering student @UNSW.  
I currently love working with Python, Java, SQL, shell scripting, and im hoping to break into more fun arduino projects.  
In my spare time you'll find me playing badminton, golf (im learning!), loading up a video game, running, hanging out with friends or watching anime :)

### about my blog:
I wanted a medium to help me keep up and continue to learn about what im passionate about - **cybersecurity**. So you'll find me writing about anything new I've learnt (these will probably not be the best educational posts, but probably intro's to topics or briefer explanations) or any cyber news I've come across.  
Additionally, I'll be writing personal more random posts here and there, all posts will be organised by **tags**.
