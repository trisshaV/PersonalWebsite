Generally, there's alot i'd like to get started on. Uni holidays always bring about a spirit of motivation that quickly depletes after a glance of your calendar - and somehow, five weeks have passed.

Nevertheless, Im glad I can finally tick creating this blog off my list, it's been there for awhile T-T  
Before uni starts, I'd like to finish coding my 4WD car, and start on the course towards a (ISC)^2 CC certification. I'd love to graduate from golf driving ranges to a golf course as well, but im definitely more than a few lessons behind.  

And of course, enjoy the summer! It's criminal I haven't gone to the beach _once_ since december started, but I've got a group trip planned to port macquarie to look forward to. ðŸ¤­
